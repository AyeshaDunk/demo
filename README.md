# Introduction for the Data Science and AI Educators Programme

The Turing’s vision to support skills and capacity building in data science education on a national level has paved the way for our new Data Science and AI Educators’ Programme

experts.  

 ## Aims
- To embed Data Science and AI training across a range of disciplines. 
- To overcome barriers to Data Science and AI training practices by empowering domain experts to become educators.  
- To stimulate the development of open and inclusive learning materials and curricula. 

## Applicants
- [] You have a keen interest in the teaching of data science and AI
- [] You have a interest in pedagogy
